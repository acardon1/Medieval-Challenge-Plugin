# Minecraft Plugins

Experimenting with coding in Java. 
Specifically Minecraft and developing plugins.

## Planned Functionality
- [ ] Voting for a Ruler
> There will be four teams, each team will elect a Ruler. The Ruler has more rules placed on him. (Can just make this soft and implied)
- [ ] Lives System
> Every player will have a certain amount of lives, display the remaining as a message when they revive, and who their Ruler is?
- [ ] Teams System
> Maybe make a custom Scoreboard (that can be turned off) to display on everyone's screens. This will tell them their Ruler's HP and how many lives each member has left. Automate team reassignment and maybe send a message when your Ruler has been slain and who the new one is.
- [ ] Kill Orders
> Rulers can't be killed by other team's members when their Ruler is not online, might let this be soft and implied.
- [ ] Mail System
> Although this is a competition between four teams, politics will add an unique layer of chaos. Allow for a system to send and receive mail, maybe using chests with sign markers on them.
